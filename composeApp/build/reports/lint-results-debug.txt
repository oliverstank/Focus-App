   Explanation for issues of type "NewApi":
   This check scans through all the Android API calls in the application and
   warns about any calls that are not available on all versions targeted by
   this application (according to its minimum SDK attribute in the manifest).

   If you really want to use this API and don't need to support older devices
   just set the minSdkVersion in your build.gradle or AndroidManifest.xml
   files.

   If your code is deliberately accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured
   (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called
   on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with
   the @TargetApi annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such
   as @TargetApi(11), such that this check considers 11 rather than your
   manifest file's minimum SDK as the required API level.

   If you are deliberately setting android: attributes in style definitions,
   make sure you place this in a values-vNN folder in order to avoid running
   into runtime conflicts on certain devices where manufacturers have added
   custom attributes whose ids conflict with the new ones on later platforms.

   Similarly, you can use tools:targetApi="11" in an XML file to indicate that
   the element will only be inflated in an adequate context.

/Users/mac/Desktop/hackathonforcactus/composeApp/build.gradle.kts:26: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk = 35
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html
   as well as follow this guide:

class SplashActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "CustomSplashScreen":
   Starting in Android 12 (API 31+), the application's Launch Screen is
   provided by the system and the application should not create its own,
   otherwise the user will see two splashscreens. Please check the
   SplashScreen class to check how the Splash Screen can be controlled and
   customized.

/Users/mac/Desktop/hackathonforcactus/composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/cactus/example/DumbModeViewModel.kt:45: Warning: As of Android 11, this method no longer returns information about all apps; see https://g.co/dev/packagevisibility for details [QueryPermissionsNeeded]
            val apps = packageManager.getInstalledApplications(android.content.pm.PackageManager.GET_META_DATA)
                                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "QueryPermissionsNeeded":
   Apps that target Android 11 cannot query or interact with other installed
   apps by default. If you need to query or interact with other installed
   apps, you may need to add a <queries> declaration in your manifest.

   As a corollary, the methods PackageManager#getInstalledPackages and
   PackageManager#getInstalledApplications will no longer return information
   about all installed apps. To query specific apps or types of apps, you can
   use methods like PackageManager#getPackageInfo or
   PackageManager#queryIntentActivities.

agp = "8.7.3"
      ~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "AndroidGradlePluginVersion":
   This detector looks for usage of the Android Gradle Plugin where the
   version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older
   versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick
   with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more
   recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

    implementation("androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1")
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/Users/mac/Desktop/hackathonforcactus/composeApp/build.gradle.kts:31: Warning: Missing x86_64 ABI support for ChromeOS [ChromeOsAbiSupport]
            abiFilters += listOf("arm64-v8a", "armeabi-v7a")
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ChromeOsAbiSupport":
   To properly support ChromeOS, your Android application should have an x86
   and/or x86_64 binary as part of the build configuration. To fix the issue,
   ensure your files are properly optimized for ARM; the binary translator
   will then ensure compatibility with x86. Alternatively, add an abiSplit for
   x86 within your build.gradle file and create the required x86
   dependencies.

/Users/mac/Desktop/hackathonforcactus/composeApp/src/androidMain/res/drawable-v24: Warning: This folder configuration (v24) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 24. Merge all the resources in this folder into drawable. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

/Users/mac/Desktop/hackathonforcactus/composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/cactus/example/App.kt:34: Information: Prefer mutableIntStateOf instead of mutableStateOf [AutoboxingStateCreation from androidx.compose.runtime]
    var selectedTab by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
                                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "AutoboxingStateCreation":
   Calling mutableStateOf<T>() when T is either backed by a primitive type on
   the JVM or is a value class results in a state implementation that requires
   all state values to be boxed. This usually causes an additional allocation
   for each state write, and adds some additional work to auto-unbox values
   when reading the value of the state. Instead, prefer to use a specialized
   primitive state implementation for Int, Long, Float, and Double when the
   state does not need to track null values and does not override the default
   SnapshotMutationPolicy. See mutableIntStateOf(), mutableLongStateOf(),
   mutableFloatStateOf(), and mutableDoubleStateOf() for more information.

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

/Users/mac/Desktop/hackathonforcactus/composeApp/src/androidMain/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: Launcher icon used as round icon did not have a circular shape [IconLauncherShape]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/designer/material/iconography) your
   launcher icons should "use a distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional,
   front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that
   users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDipSize":
   Checks the all icons which are provided in multiple densities, all compute
   to roughly the same density-independent pixel (dip) size. This catches
   errors where images are either placed in the wrong folder, or icons are
   changed to new sizes but some folders are forgotten.

/Users/mac/Desktop/hackathonforcactus/composeApp/src/androidMain/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: The following unrelated icon files have identical contents: ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png, ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png, ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png, ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png, ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png [IconDuplicates]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicates":
   If an icon is repeated under different names, you can consolidate and just
   use one of the icons and delete the others to make your application
   smaller. However, duplicated icons usually are not intentional and can
   sometimes point to icons that were accidentally overwritten or accidentally
   not updated.
