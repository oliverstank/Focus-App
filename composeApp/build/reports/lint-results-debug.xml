        explanation="Calling `mutableStateOf&lt;T>()` when `T` is either backed by a primitive type on the JVM or is a value class results in a state implementation that requires all state values to be boxed. This usually causes an additional allocation for each state write, and adds some additional work to auto-unbox values when reading the value of the state. Instead, prefer to use a specialized primitive state implementation for `Int`, `Long`, `Float`, and `Double` when the state does not need to track null values and does not override the default `SnapshotMutationPolicy`. See `mutableIntStateOf()`, `mutableLongStateOf()`, `mutableFloatStateOf()`, and `mutableDoubleStateOf()` for more information."
